<h2>Installation of all server components</h2>

<p>There is a Makefile that will compile what is needed, so just:
<pre>$ make</pre>
<p>The executables are in the build/bin subdirectory and plugins in build/lib</p>

<p>A number of the plugins and servers require development libraries from the linux distribution.</p>
<p>See http://timmy.elektro.dtu.dk/rse/wiki (howto install on (k)ubuntu) for further info</p>
