<!-- odometry
     cl is distance in meters for each encoder value (forward is positive)
     cr is distance in meters for each encoder value or 0, if only one encoder
     w is distance between differential drive wheels (type=differential only)
     robotlength is distance between steering-axle (front) and fixed axle (back)
     steeringangleoffset is steeringangleoffset subtracted from steeringangle (radians) ackerman only
     maxtick is maximum encoder change in one sample time to be regarded valid
     control is 0: wheel-encoder (steeringangle or differential from RHD)
                1: gyro based heading
                2: provided curvature from RHD
     enctype is 0: absolute encoder value from RHD (default)
                1: encoder change in one sample time from RHD
     encwheel is 0: if encoder is on rear wheel(s), 
                 1: if encoder on front axle/wheels
     gyrotype is 0: gyro angle provided by RHD
                 1: gyro angle change in sample interval provided by RHD
